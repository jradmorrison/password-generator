# Password Generator

## Description

This web app can be used to generate a random password of 8-128 characters of your choosing. I built this application using JavaScript to put what I've been learning into action and really test myself to build a working app with logical operators and conditional statements.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this application simply press the generate button and follow the on screen prompts. Your custom password will appear in the box once all conditions have been met!
